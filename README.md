## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of projects that I created while learning and practicing JavaScript.🔖 The projects range from simple scripts to more complex applications, including some that utilize APIs⚙️. These projects are meant to showcase my progress and skills in JavaScript, as well as serve as a reference for future development.📈
