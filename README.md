## Introduction

"Welcome to my JavaScript projects repository!👋 This repository contains a collection of projects that I created while learning and practicing JavaScript.🔖 The projects range from simple scripts to more complex applications, including some that utilize APIs⚙️. These projects are meant to showcase my progress and skills in JavaScript, as well as serve as a reference for future development.📈

Below, you will find screenshots🖼 of some of the projects included in this repository. These screenshots give you a glimpse of what each project looks like and how it functions.🗂

I hope that these projects will be helpful for others who are also learning JavaScript. If you find my projects helpful or interesting, please consider starring the repository to show your support!"🤗
